# 🚀 Helmet & Speed Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
This cutting-edge project leverages **computer vision** and **machine learning** to detect **helmet violations** and **monitor vehicle speeds**. Using **OpenCV, EasyOCR, and Ultralytics**, it processes live or recorded video footage to ensure road safety and compliance with traffic regulations.

## 🌟 Features & Capabilities
✅ **Helmet Detection** – Identifies riders without helmets using advanced object detection.
✅ **Speed Monitoring** – Calculates vehicle speeds and flags violations.
✅ **Violation Tracking** – Captures and logs details of rule-breaking incidents.
✅ **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** – User-friendly interface for seamless operation.
✅ **Real-time Processing** – Works with live video feeds or pre-recorded footage.
✅ **Automated Reporting** – Generates logs for detected violations.

## 🛠 Installation & Setup
Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed, then run the following command to install all required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎬 How to Run
Start the application using:
```bash
python gui.py
```
This will launch the interactive GUI, allowing you to load video footage, process live feeds, and analyze results effortlessly.

## 🔗 Technologies Used
- **Pillow** – Image Processing
- **OpenCV** – Computer Vision
- **EasyOCR** – Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- **Pandas** – Data Handling & Analysis
- **Ultralytics** – YOLO-based Object Detection
